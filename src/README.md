# Graph Algorithm Visualiser (In development)

This application, built in the Unity engine, allows users to run a suite of graph algorithms and observe their individual steps.

Users can create their own graphs from scratch, or import large graphs from others sources.

The application provides a performant renderer to visualise large graphs with good performance.
